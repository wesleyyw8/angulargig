## my thoughts:
I used bootstrap4 and angular 7 in order to build the website.  
it contains a landing page, login, game browser, logout and display username pages as required.  
it contains the unit tests and css animations.  
it validates the password as required on the spec  
it has a search box to filter the games by its name  
it has a button to sort the list of games  
the logout funcionality "cleans the session"  
about redux:  
I didnt use ngrx (redux of angular) because the application is too small for it. but you can take a look at my github and see other projects of mine.  
also you can check it out with your redux chrome dev tools on the following url https://www.holidayautos.com/en/transfers#/search   

home/user/auth-guard is a controller runned before we hit the user page.  
home/login/auth.service is the service to store the user information.
