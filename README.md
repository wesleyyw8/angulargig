my thoughts:
I used bootstrap4 and angular 7 in order to build the website. 
Most of my bootstrap components have inline style (im not a fan of using important)  
home/user/auth-guard is a controller runned before we hit the user page.  
home/login/auth.service is the service to store the user information.  
I didnt use ngrx (redux of angular) because the application is too small for it. but you can take a look at my github and see other projects of mine.  
also you can check it out with your redux chrome dev tools on the following url https://www.holidayautos.com/en/transfers#/search
